# BoardGame-O-Matic (German: Brettspiel-O-Mat)

### An online tool that suggests users matching board games from a given collection based on their preferences

## PREREQUISITES

- Some **web-space** (a cheap shared-hosting plan is sufficient)
- **No** PHP or MySQL / MariaDB needed (optional for statistics)
- **No** npm or any other packaging manager needed

## USE / INSTALLATION

1. **Download and unpack** ZIP archive

2. **Edit** `/data/definition.js`.

3. **Edit** the `CSV files` with the questions and the answers. Use [generate-csv-file-for-boardgame-o-matic](https://github.com/fenglisch/generate-csv-file-for-boardgame-o-matic) to generate the file with your board game data.

4. **Test settings** using `INDEX.HTML` (works best on http://localhost/ or your private webspace)

**Optional:** You can find some **addons** in the folder `/extras`. It adds some more functionality to the program, if needed.

## DATA PROTECTION / GDPR

- All evaluations happen inside the user's browsers
- No data is collected on a server
  - Exception: default access-logging by your webhosting-provider, i.e. IP-address and time
  - Collecting anonymous user data on how they answered the questions for statistical purposes is optional and required user opt-in
- No external network requests (e.g. Content Delivery Network / CDN, Bootstrap, jQuery, no Social Media-plugin) - all included
